### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Design Systems, with emphasis on design tokens.
- 👨‍💻 I'm one of those confused UX Engineers who tries to navigate the intersection of design, development and strategy.
- 💬 Ask me about that one time I accidentally went into the wrong apartment after being out in the sun too long.
